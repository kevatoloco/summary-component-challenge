## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- TailwindCSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library


### What I learned

This is my first time using react and tailwindcss. I learned a lot about how to structure my divs and use flexbox and media query. I also learned that you really have to pay close attention the details of the design to closely match it. Having a good foundation and structure will help coding a lot down the line.

### Continued development

I want to get better using tailwind and react in general. I want to continue focusing on learning how to use grid and flexbox to create responsive designs. 


### Useful resources

- [https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation] The whole tailwindcss documentation was incrediably helpful in learning how to use tailwind. It was very in depth and covers so many topics.
